## ✨ Features

- **Modern & Sleek UI:** A clean, fast, and clutter-free interface designed for the modern web.
- **Best of Both Worlds:** Combines the simple direct messaging of WhatsApp with the rich community structure of Discord.
- **Real-time Engine:** Ultra-fast messaging, rich media sharing, and instant updates.

## 🚀 Local Development

If you want to contribute or test the project locally:

```bash
## Windows:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SereSChat/SereS.git
cd SereS

# 2. python venv
python -m venv .venv
./\.venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start development server
python src/backend/app.py


## Linux:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SereSChat/SereS.git
cd SereS

# 2. python venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start development server
python src/backend/app.py
```

The frontend is written in TypeScript (`src/frontend/`). It is compiled to
`src/public/` and the compiled `.js` files are committed;
after changing a `.ts` file run `tsc -p .` in the repository root.

Backend tests: `pip install pytest && python -m pytest tests`

Optional environment variables: `PORT`, `HOST`, `SERES_DEBUG=1` (never in production),
`SERES_DATA_DIR` (where `users.db` and avatars are stored), `SERES_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
(extra hostnames allowed as request `Origin`, comma separated), `URL` (uptime heartbeat).

## 🖥️ Install on a server (Ubuntu / Debian)

One script installs everything that is missing (Python + venv, git, Node.js + npm, pm2),
downloads SereS, sets up the venv and keeps SereS running with pm2, also after a reboot:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SereSChat/SereS/main/deploy/install.sh
bash install.sh --public-url https://beta.seres-chat.com --rp-id seres-chat.com
```

Run it as the user SereS should run as (it asks for `sudo`). SereS then listens on
`http://localhost:2222`; point your Cloudflare tunnel or reverse proxy there. To update
later, run `~/SereS/deploy/install.sh` again: it pulls the newest version and restarts SereS.
All options: [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).

## 🔒 How the end-to-end encryption works

- **Your password never reaches the server in usable form.** The browser derives a master key with
  PBKDF2-SHA256 (600,000 iterations, random salt) and splits it with HKDF into an *auth hash*
  (sent to the server, stored with Argon2id) and a *key-wrapping key* (never leaves the device).
- **Identity keys:** on registration the browser creates a P-256 ECDH key pair (encryption) and a
  P-256 ECDSA key pair (signatures). The private keys are uploaded only after being encrypted with
  the key-wrapping key (AES-256-GCM). After login they are unlocked and stored in IndexedDB as
  *non-extractable* WebCrypto keys.
- **Messages:** every message gets a fresh AES-256-GCM key. That key is wrapped for each chat
  member with a pairwise key derived from ECDH + HKDF, and the whole envelope (chat, message id,
  sender, ciphertext, wrapped keys) is signed with the sender's ECDSA key. The server checks that
  a message is encrypted for exactly the current members, but can neither read nor forge it.
- **Groups:** new members only receive keys for messages sent after they joined.
- **Attachments:** every file is encrypted in the browser with its own AES-256-GCM key. The
  server only stores the ciphertext; the key travels inside the encrypted, signed message.
  Reactions, replies and forwarded messages are encrypted the same way.
- **Verification:** each chat shows a 60-digit security code (like WhatsApp/Signal). Compare it
  with your contact; contacts' key fingerprints are pinned on first use and you get a warning
  (and sending is blocked) if the server ever hands out a different key.
- **Limits:** this is not the Signal protocol – there is no forward secrecy (a stolen password +
  server database exposes old messages), and metadata (who chats with whom, when) is visible to
  the server (also that a message is a reaction, which messages are pinned and the
  disappearing-messages timer). Messages from before v1.1 stay readable and are marked *not encrypted*.

## 🔑 Forgot password: backup codes and e-mail reset

- **Backup codes (keep everything):** after registering – and later in the settings – you get
  10 codes like `K7QF-2M9X-HP4C-ZT8B`, shown **only once** (download them as `.txt` or copy
  them). Each code works once. The browser encrypts the private keys separately with a key
  derived from each code (PBKDF2 + HKDF, 80-bit codes); the server only stores the encrypted
  keys and an Argon2 hash per code. With a code, "Forgot password?" unlocks the keys in the
  browser, encrypts them again with the new password and **all chats stay readable**.
  Generating new codes makes all old ones invalid.
- **E-mail reset (fallback):** a link valid for 60 minutes. Without the password or a code the
  old keys can't be unlocked, so new keys are created: friends, groups and chats stay, but the
  user can't read their **own copy** of old messages anymore (they are hidden for them). The
  other members keep the full history; the old public keys are kept so they can still verify
  old messages. Contacts see a "security key changed" warning, like in WhatsApp.

## 🛡️ Two-factor authentication (optional)

In the settings everyone can turn on a second factor for the login:

- **Passkeys** (WebAuthn): a phone, a security key, Windows Hello, Touch ID … On a computer the
  browser offers "use a phone or tablet" and shows a QR code, so the phone works as passkey.
- **Authenticator apps** (TOTP, 6-digit codes): Google/Microsoft Authenticator, Aegis, 1Password …
- **Backup codes** also work as second factor if the device is lost.

With 2FA on, the server only starts a session – and only hands out the encrypted keys – after
the second factor. Adding or removing a factor needs the current password. The e-mail reset is
not possible while 2FA is on (the mailbox alone must not be enough); use a backup code instead.

Passkeys need HTTPS (or `localhost`) and are bound to the domain. Set `PUBLIC_URL` (or
`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`) in `.env` when SereS runs behind a reverse proxy.

## ✉️ E-mail setup (for password reset links)

SereS sends mails through any SMTP server, configured in `src/backend/.env`:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=localhost          # unset = e-mail reset disabled
SMTP_PORT=25                 # 587 for STARTTLS, 465 for SSL
SMTP_SECURITY=none           # starttls (default), ssl or none
SMTP_USER=                   # optional
SMTP_PASSWORD=               # optional
MAIL_FROM="SereS <no-reply@example.com>"
PUBLIC_URL=https://chat.example.com   # used for the links in the mails
# MAIL_DEBUG=1               # development: print mails to the console instead
```

To run your own send-only mail server on Ubuntu (Postfix + DKIM, no open ports):

```bash
sudo ./deploy/setup-mailserver.sh --domain example.com \
     --public-url https://chat.example.com \
     --seres-env /path/to/SereS/src/backend/.env \
     --test-to you@example.org
```

It prints the DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and the reverse DNS (PTR) entry you have to set.
Many hosters block outgoing port 25 until you ask them to unblock it. Instead of your own
server you can also use any SMTP provider (Mailjet, Brevo, Postmark, your mail host, ...).
